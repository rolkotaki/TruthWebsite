# TruthWebsite


TruthWebsite is meant to be a news website.
I used technologies such as Java, JSP, Hibernate, MySQL, JavaScript and AJAX.

I started working on the TruthWebsite project to practise my web development skills.

Please be aware in some cases probably the used solution or technology is not as per the best practice, but my initial goal was to practise as many things as possible, so I implemented solutions accordingly.

Info: I started this home project in 2016, however, I stopped it and never finished since then. The reason for stopping it was that I moved to a different country. There are some functionalities that work though.
For example if you go to /TruthWebsite/admin.jsp, the admin menu and functionalities work. If you add categories, articles and navigate back to the home page, you will see the newly added articles.

It runs on a MySQL database and I used NetBeans as the developer environment.

Used MySQL version: 5.5.24
(Might be important for Hibernate.)

Admin username: admin
<br>Admin password: alma

To create the database for the application please execute truth_website.sql file.
Command in MySQL command line, depending on the file path:<br>
source c:\truth_website.sql
